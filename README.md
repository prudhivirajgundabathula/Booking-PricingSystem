# Booking-PricingSystem
Objective : Build a mini full-stack system that lets users book workspaces (meeting rooms) by the hour — with real-world features like conflict prevention, dynamic pricing, cancellation policies, and admin analytics.  This test measures your backend logic, architecture discipline, and clean coding style, not just your ability to make things work.
